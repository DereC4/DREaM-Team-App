As part of this intern-based hackathon-styled innovation challenge, we created Language Assist!

Our team plans to integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) into call center operations, aiming to deliver AI-assisted responses that are linguistically tailored to each caller's preferences and needs. This cutting-edge approach is designed to ensure that all communications are not only efficient and personalized but also conducted in the language or dialect that the customer feels most comfortable with. Using open source models as a proof of concept, we can show how one person's voice can be adapted to many different languages.
